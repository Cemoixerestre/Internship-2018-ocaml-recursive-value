\section{Introduction}
OCaml is a statically-types functionnal language of the ML family. One of the
features of the language is the \lstinline|let rec| operator. It is usually
used to define recursive functions, but it can also be used to define recursive
values.

For example, the following code:
\begin{lstlisting}
let rec x = 1 :: x
\end{lstlisting}
creates an infinite list containing only ones.

However, not all definitions can be computed. For example, definitions like:
\begin{lstlisting}
let rec x = x + 1
\end{lstlisting}
should be rejected by the compiler, because if such a definition is accepted, it
can lead to bugs such as segfault. % add a reference?
% [Gabriel] Why should this be rejected by the compiler?

Previously, this check relied on \textit{ad hoc} rules \cite{PreviousRules},
which caused several issues. In 2016, Jeremy Yallop proposed a new check,
designed as a simplified typing system \cite{Yallop}. One of the problem is that
his system is too complex, and it is hard to reason about.

During this internship, I investigated the current system and (following the
intuition of Gabriel Scherer) and rewrote it as an inference rules system. Then,
I designed a simpler system. I implemented it in the compiler and successfully
managed to pass the testsuite. Also, examining Jeremy Yallop's code, Gabriel and
I found a bug and sent a pull request to fix it.

\section{The current system}
The current system, since OCaml 4.06, is the one that has been proposed by
Jeremy Yallop. Here is an overview of this system.

\subsection{Access modes}
Three \textit{access modes} are used in this system. These modes are:
\begin{description}
  \item[Deref] : the value of a variable is accessed.
  \item[Guarded] : the address of a variable is either placed in a constructor,
    either in an expression that is lazily evaluated, either unused.
  \item[Unguarded] : the address of a variable is not used in a guarded
    context.
\end{description}

For example:
\begin{itemize}
  \item In the expression \lstinline|x + 1|, the variable \lstinline|x| is
    accessed in the $\Deref$ mode because its value must be accessed before
    being used as a function argument.
  \item In the expression \lstinline|1 :: x|, the variable \lstinline|x| is 
    accessed in the $\Guarded$ mode. The address of \lstinline|x| is used in
    the construction of the list, be it does not require the evaluation of
    \lstinline|x|.
  \item In the expression \lstinline|fun () -> x|, the variable \lstinline|x|
    is accessed in the $\Guarded$ mode, because the body of this function is
    lazily evaluated, so it does not require the evaluation of \lstinline|x|.
  \item Considere the expression \lstinline |let rec x = let y = x in ...|
    In the definition of the variable \lstinline|y|, the variable
    \lstinline|x| is neither evaluated, nor placed in a constructor, nor lazily
    evaluated. \lstinline|x| is considered being used in the $\Unguarded$ mode.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Types and Environments}
In this system, types $T$ are maps that associate an access mode to each
variable.
Intuitively, the type of an expression gives the use of variables in the
definition of the expression.

Environments $\Gamma$ are maps that associate a type to each variable.

In this system, environments are inputs and types are are outputs. The type of
an expression is evaluated given an environment.

\subsection{Operations}
Some operations are defined on modes:
\begin{displaymath}
  \begin{array}{lll}
    \guard(\Unguarded)              & = & \Guarded \\
    \guard(m \neq \Unguarded)       & = & m        \\
    \inspect(m)                     & = & \Deref   \\
    \delay(m)                       & = & \Guarded \\
    \discard(m)                     & = & \guard(m)
  \end{array}
\end{displaymath}

These operations are generalized on types.
% Should I describe more precesily what I mean, or is it clear?

% [Gabriel] "precesily" is a typo that would have caught by
% a spellchecker. You should find out how to run a spellcheck from
% your favorite text editor, and run it from times to times. In Emacs
% I use "M-x ispell".

It is possible to define an total order on modes:
$$\Deref > \Unguarded > \Guarded$$
We have $m > m'$ if the mode $m$ is more constraining than the mode $m'$.

So, let $m + m'$ denote the maximal mode between $m$ and $m'$, with respect to
this order relation. Note that this operation is called \textit{prec} in
Jeremy Yallop's code.

We can generalize this definition for types and environments:
\begin{displaymath}
  \begin{array}{lll}
    (T + T')           & : x \rightarrow & T(x) + T'(x) \\
    (\Gamma + \Gamma') & : x \rightarrow & \Gamma(x) + \Gamma'(x)
  \end{array}
\end{displaymath}

with:

\begin{displaymath}
  \begin{array}{lll}
    T(x) = \Guarded       & \text{if} & x \notin dom(T) \\
    \Gamma(x) = \emptyset & \text{if} & x \notin dom(\Gamma)
  \end{array}
\end{displaymath}

\subsection{The Check Algorithm}

The check is performed recursively. Every node of the abstract syntax tree
\footnote{defined in the module \texttt{Typedtree}, that is defined is the
files \texttt{typing/typedtree.mli} and \texttt{typing/typedtree.ml}} is
checked. If it is a node with the form:
\begin{lstlisting}[mathescape=true]
let rec $x_1$ = $e_1$ and ... and $x_n$ = $e_n$
\end{lstlisting}
An environment $\Gamma = (x_i: (x_i: \Unguarded))^i$ is created.
Then, the types of the expressions $e_i$ are computed in the environment
$\Gamma$. If a variable is used in an unguarded mode (\textit{i.e} in mode
$\Unguarded$ or $\Deref$) in one of these types, then the compiler rejects this
expression.

\subsection{Inference Rules}
Originally, Jeremy Yallop just gave an implementation of this
check. Gabriel Scherer proposed a first draft of inference rules
corresponding to this implementation \cite{GascheComment1, GascheComment2}.

This system works as follow: conclusions have the form
$$\Gamma \vdash e: T$$
where $\Gamma$ is an environment, $e$ is an expression and $T$ a type. As
explained above, the environment is the input and the type is the ouput.

The main rules are:
\begin{mathpar}
  \infer*{ }
         {\Gamma, x: T \vdash x: T}

  \infer*
    {x \notin \Gamma}
    {\Gamma \vdash x: \emptyset}
  \\
  \infer*{\Gamma \vdash e_1: T_1 \\
          \Gamma \vdash e_2: T_2}
         {\Gamma \vdash \tapply{e_1}{e_2}: \inspect(T_1 + T_2)}

  \infer*{\Gamma \vdash e: T}
         {\Gamma \vdash \tfun x e: \delay(T)}
  \\
  \infer*
    {(\Gamma \vdash e_i: T_i)^i}
    {\Gamma \vdash K(e_1, ..., e_n): \guard(T_1 + ... + T_n)}
  \\
  \infer*
    {\Gamma \vdash e_1: T_1 \\
     \Gamma, x : A \vdash e_2: T_2}
    {\Gamma \vdash \tlet{x}{e_1}{e_2}: discard(T_1) + T_2}
\end{mathpar}
% Should I give a short explanation?

% [Gabriel]: yes, you should give a short informal explanation, of at
% least one of the rules (no need to paraphrase all of them).

\subsection{Examples}
\textit{TODO}

\subsection{Bug in the implementation}
When examining the code, Gabriel and I found a bug. It appears in the recursive
class declarations check.

Indeed, it is possible to define classes with the syntax:
\begin{lstlisting}[mathescape=true]
class $a$ = let  $x_1$ = $e_1$ and ... and $x_n$ = $e_n$ in $e$
\end{lstlisting}
The compiler check that the \lstinline|let| bindings are correct. In
particular, it is not allowed to use the class $a$ that is being defined in the
$\Deref$ mode (for example, when creating an object with the keyword
\lstinline|new|).

% [Gabriel]: the explanation here is wrong, and I don't know whether
% it is on purpose (a simplification) or not. The problem is not the
% `let rec`, we don't need `rec` to create bad examples (and I think
% it would be clearer if you did *not* use `rec` in this sectoin), it
% is about using the class with `new` from within the class definition:
%
% class a =
%   let x = ... new a ... in
%   object ... end

The problem was that in the previous check, the expressions affected to
variables bound in the \lstinline|let| and the class expression $e$ were
typed separately. For example, in the definition:
\begin{lstlisting}[mathescape=true]
class a = let x = $e_x$ in let y = $e_y$ in $e$
\end{lstlisting}
it is possible to make an incorrect use of the variable \lstinline|x| in the
expression $e_y$.

Gabriel found that the definition:
\begin{lstlisting}
class a = let x () = new a in let _y = x () in object end
\end{lstlisting}
caused a segfault.

I wrote a patch that fix this bug, added new tests and sent a pull request,
with the help of Gabriel \cite{PullRequest}.

% Note that this bug only appears since the version 4.06.

\section{A new system}

% TODO: give an short introduction, with motivations, and cite comments of
% Gabriel about this system.

\subsection{Modes, types and environments}
In Jeremy's system, access modes refer to way variables are used in expressions.
In this new system, modes are also used to describe the context in which
expressions are defined and evaluated.

Also, a problem of Jeremy's system is that the $\Guarded$ mode has a lot of
different meanings. To be more expressive, this mode is split into three modes
in this system: $\Guarded$, $\Delayed$ and $\Unused$. So there are now five
modes:

\begin{description}
  \item[Deref]: it refer to an expression that is evaluated and inspected, or to
    a variable such that its value is inspected.
  \item[Guarded]: it refer to a variable such that its address is used in some
    datastructure (for example: a constructor) but the variable has not been
    inspected. It also refer to an expression such that its address will used
    in such a context.
  \item[Delayed]: it refer to an expression such that its evaluation is delayed,
    or to a variable only used in delayed expressions.
  \item[Unused]: it refer to an unused variable.
  \item[Unguarded]: it refer to a variable such that its value is not inspected,
    and that its address is directly placed in a variable, not placed in some
    datastructure.
\end{description}

For example:
\begin{itemize}
  \item In the expression \lstinline|x + (y * z)|, both the variable
    \lstinline|x| and the expression \lstinline|y * z| are used in the $\Deref$
    mode.
  \item In the expression \lstinline|(f x) :: y|, both the variable
    \lstinline|y| and the expression \lstinline|f x| are used in the $\Guarded$
    mode.
  \item In the expression \lstinline|fun () -> 1 + x|, since the expression
    \lstinline|1 + x| is evaluated just when this function is called, this
    expression is used in the $\Delayed$ mode. Consequently, the variable
    \lstinline|x| is also used in the $\Delayed$ mode.
  \item In the expression \lstinline|fun x -> y + z|, as \lstinline|x| does not
    appear in the expression \lstinline|y + z|, \lstinline|x| is used in the
    mode $\Unused$ in the last expression.
  \item In the expression \lstinline|let y = x in y|, as the locally defined
    variable \lstinline|y| uses the value \lstinline|x| but does not require the
    inspection of \lstinline|x|, as the address of \lstinline|x| is not placed
    in some datastructure, and as \lstinline|y| is returned, the variable
    \lstinline|x| is used in the $\Unguarded$ mode in the overall expression.

  % \item A more subtle example: in the expression
   % \lstinline|let rec f = fun() -> f in f| (the option \verb|-rectypes| must
    %be passed to the compiler to accept it), the address of the variable
    % \lstinline|f| is used in the environment stored in this closure.
\end{itemize}

In this system, a type is simply a mode $m$ in which an experssion is
evaluated. An environment $\Gamma$ is a map that associate to variables a mode.
By default, if a variable does appear in the domain of this map, this variable
is associated to $\Unused$.

Contrary to the previous system, types are used as inputs and environments are
used as outputs. Intuitively, given an expression $e$ and a mode $m$, the
computed environment $\Gamma$ indicates how the variable not locally bound in
$e$ must be accessed to use $e$ in the mode $m$.

\subsection{Relations between modes}
With these new modes, we can similarly define an order relation:
$$\Deref > \Unguarded > \Guarded > \Delayed > \Unused$$
We can define how to join two environments $\Gamma$ and $\Gamma'$ in the same
way, and use the same notation $\Gamma + \Gamma'$.

A key concept in this new system is the composition of modes. If a variable $x$
is used in an expression $e$ in mode $m$, and that this expression $e$ is used
in an expression $e'$ in mode $e'$, let $m'[m]$ denote the mode in which the
variable $x$ is used in the expression $e'$. This is called the
\textit{composition} of modes $m'$ and $m$.  We can compute the composition of two modes in this way: \begin{displaymath} \begin{array}{lll} \Deref [m]     & = & \Deref   \\
    \Delayed [m]   & = & \Delayed \\
    m[\Unguarded]  & = & m        \\
    \Unguarded [m] & = & m        \\
    \Guarded [m]   & = & m        \\
  \end{array}
\end{displaymath}
% Gabriel: You could write e[x] for e with x that occurs in it, and
% e'[e[x]] for e' with e[x] that occurs in it.

% Alban: I don't know exactly how to use this notation, so I used my own words.

For example:
\begin{itemize}
  \item In the expression \lstinline|fun () -> x + 1|, the variable
    \lstinline|x| is used in the $\Deref$ mode in the expression
    \lstinline|x + 1|. But this expression is used in the mode $\Delayed$ in the
    expression \lstinline|fun () -> x + 1|. We can notice that the evaluation of
    x could be delayed in this function, so \lstinline|x| is used in mode
    $\Delayed$ in the overall expression. Indeed, we have
    $\Delayed [\Deref] = \Delayed$.

  \item In the expression \lstinline|Some (x + 1)|, even if the expression
    \lstinline|x + 1| is used in mode $\Guarded$, the variable \lstinline|x|
    must be inpected to evaluate both the expression \lstinline|x + 1| and the
    overall expression. Indeed, we have $\Guarded [\Deref] = \Deref$.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{The Check Algorithm}

Similarly to the previous system, the check is performed when expressions of the
form
\begin{lstlisting}[mathescape=true]
  let rec $x_1$ = $e_1$ and ... and $x_n$ = $e_n$
\end{lstlisting}
are encountered.

The types of the expressions $e_i$ are computed with the mode $m = \Unguarded$
set as the input. If a variable among the $e_i$ is used in an unguarded mode,
then the compiler rejects this expression.

\subsection{Inference rules}
In this system, deduction rules have the form: $$\Gamma \vdash e: m$$
where $\Gamma$ is a context, $e$ is an expression and $m$ is a mode.

As explained above, the mode $m$ is set as the input, and the environment
$\Gamma$ is the output.

The main rules are:
\begin{mathpar}
  \infer*{c~\text{is a constant}}
         {\emptyset \vdash c: m}

  \infer*{ }
         {x: m \vdash x: m}
  \\
  \infer*{\Gamma, x: \_ \vdash e: m[\Delayed]}
         {\Gamma \vdash \tfun x e : m}

  \infer*{\Gamma_1 \vdash e_1: m[\Deref] \\
          \Gamma_2 \vdash e_2: m[\Deref]}
         {\Gamma_1 + \Gamma_2 \vdash \tapply{e_1}{e_2}: m}
  \\
  \infer*{(\Gamma_i \vdash e_i: m[\Guarded])^i}
         {\Gamma_1 + ... + \Gamma_n \vdash K(e_1, ..., e_n): m}
  \\
  \infer*{\Gamma_1 \vdash e_1: m[m_x + \Guarded] \\
          \Gamma_2, x: m_x \vdash e_2: m}
         {\Gamma_1 + \Gamma_2 \vdash \tlet{x}{e_1}{e_2}: m}
\end{mathpar}

\subsection{Implementation}
% After having designed

Here are some extracts of the implementation:
\begin{lstlisting}
open Asttypes
open Typedtree
open Types

type mode =
    Dereferenced
  | Guarded
  | Delayed
  | Unused
  | Unguarded

let compos : mode -> mode -> mode =
(* ... *)

module Env :
sig
  type t
  val join : t -> t -> t
  (* ... *)
end =
struct
  module M = Map.Make(Ident)
  type t = mode M.t
  (* ... *)
end

(* ... *)
let rec expression : mode -> Typedtree.expression -> Env.t =
  fun mode exp -> match exp.exp_desc with
    (* ... *)
    | Texp_record { fields = es; extended_expression = eo;
                    representation = rep } ->
        let m' = match rep with
          | Record_float -> compos mode Dereferenced
          | Record_unboxed _ -> mode
          | Record_regular | Record_inlined _
          | Record_extension -> compos mode Guarded
        in
        let field m = function
            _, Kept _ -> Env.empty
          | _, Overridden (_, e) -> expression m e
        in
        Env.join (array field m' es)
                 (option expression mode eo)
    (* ... *)
and option : 'a. (mode -> 'a -> Env.t) -> mode -> 'a option
                                       -> Env.t = (* ... *)
and list : 'a. (mode -> 'a -> Env.t) -> mode -> 'a list
                                     -> Env.t = (* ... *)
and array : 'a. (mode -> 'a -> Env.t) -> mode -> 'a array
                                      -> Env.t = (* ... *)
\end{lstlisting}

The main function is the function \lstinline|expression|. It takes a mode (type
\lstinline|mode|), an expression (type \lstinline|Typedtree.expression|) and
returns an environment (type \lstinline|Env.t|).

There are also functions such as \lstinline|option|, \lstinline|list| and
\lstinline|array| that take a datastructure (an option, a list, an array) of
elements, that map these elements to environments (given a mode and a function
passed in argument) and return the join of these environments.
